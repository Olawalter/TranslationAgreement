"""Retry transport failures to the hosted StudioNet RPC - and nothing else.

The public endpoint drops connections mid-flight (TLS
SSLV3_ALERT_BAD_RECORD_MAC, resets), serves CDN 502 HTML pages instead of
JSON, and rate-limits bursts (-32429, and -32029 for reads over 30 a minute). Aborting on one of those while
polling a receipt strands an already-submitted transaction. A JSON-RPC
error that is a real answer (a revert, an unknown method) is never retried.

Re-sending is safe: a raw transaction is signed before it is sent, so its
nonce and hash are fixed and a repeat is the same transaction.
