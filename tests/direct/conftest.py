# temp file, dup2-ing that file onto fd 0 and unlinking the path while fd 0
# still references it. POSIX permits that; Windows refuses with WinError 32, so
# every direct test errors at deploy on a fresh Windows checkout. The shim
# tolerates that one refusal and changes nothing else. It is a no-op on Linux
# and macOS, so CI runs the runner as published.
